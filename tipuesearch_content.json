To accomplish this we'll use the (\"bag of words\")[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model] method to count the frequency of occurance for each word. Note: the bag of word methods assumes equal weight for all words in our \"bag\" and does not consider the order of occurance for words. There are modules that will do this for us but we will implement bag of words from scratch to understand what's happening under the hood. The steps are as follow: 1. Convert bag of words to lowercase. 2. Remove punctuation from sentences. 3. Break on each word. 4. Count the frequency of each word. import string #punctuation import pprint from collections import Counter #frequencies #Bag of Words from scratch documents = [ 'Hello, how are you!' , 'Win money, win from home.' , 'Call me now.' , 'Hello, Call hello you tomorrow?' ] lower_case_documents = [] for i in documents : lower_case_documents . append ( i . lower ()) print \"lower case:\" , lower_case_documents # Remove punctuation. sans_punctuation_documents = [] for i in lower_case_documents : sans_punctuation_documents = [ \"\" . join ( j for j in i if j not in string . punctuation ) for i in lower_case_documents ] print \"no punctuation:\" , ( sans_punctuation_documents ) #Break each word preprocessed_documents = [] for i in sans_punctuation_documents : preprocessed_documents . append ( i . split ( ' ' )) #split on space print \"break words:\" , ( preprocessed_documents ) #Count frequency of words using counter frequency_list = [] for i in preprocessed_documents : frequency_counts = Counter ( i ) frequency_list . append ( frequency_counts ) print \"tokenized counts:\" , pprint . pprint ( frequency_list ) lower case: ['hello, how are you!', 'win money, win from home.', 'call me now.', 'hello, call hello you tomorrow?'] no punctuation: ['hello how are you', 'win money win from home', 'call me now', 'hello call hello you tomorrow'] break words: [['hello', 'how', 'are', 'you'], ['win', 'money', 'win', 'from', 'home'], ['call', 'me', 'now'], ['hello', 'call', 'hello', 'you', 'tomorrow']] tokenized counts:[Counter({'how': 1, 'you': 1, 'hello': 1, 'are': 1}), Counter({'win': 2, 'home': 1, 'from': 1, 'money': 1}), Counter({'me': 1, 'now': 1, 'call': 1}), Counter({'hello': 2, 'you': 1, 'call': 1, 'tomorrow': 1})] None 2.2 SciKit-Learn Feature Extraction That was pretty simple but scikit-learn makes the process even easier. Let's try it using the sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer method from the module. from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer count_vector = CountVectorizer () #set the variable count_vector . fit ( documents ) #fit the function count_vector . get_feature_names () #get the outputs [u'are', u'call', u'from', u'hello', u'home', u'how', u'me', u'money', u'now', u'tomorrow', u'win', u'you'] Create an array where each row represents one of the 4 columns and each column represents the counts for each word within the document. doc_array = count_vector . transform ( documents ) . toarray () doc_array array([[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]]) Convert the array to a data frame and apply get_feature_names as the column names. frequency_matrix = pd . DataFrame ( doc_array , columns = count_vector . get_feature_names () ) frequency_matrix are call from hello home how me money now tomorrow win you 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 2 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 3 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 3.1 Training & Testing Sets We'll split our dataset using scikit's train_test_split method into training and testing sets so we can make inferences about the model's accuracy on data it hasn't been trained on. from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split X_train , X_test , y_train , y_test = train_test_split ( df [ 'sms_message' ], df [ 'label' ], random_state = 1 ) print \"Our original set contains\" , df . shape [ 0 ], \"observations\" print \"Our training set contains\" , X_train . shape [ 0 ], \"observations\" print \"Our testing set contains\" , X_test . shape [ 0 ], \"observations\" Our original set contains 5572 observations Our training set contains 4179 observations Our testing set contains 1393 observations Fit the training & testing data to the CountVectorizer() method and return a matrix train = count_vector . fit_transform ( X_train ) test = count_vector . transform ( X_test ) 4.1 Implementing Baye's Theorem from Scratch Baye's theorem calculates the probability of a given class or state given the joint-probability distribution of the input variables (betas). There are numerous libraries which take care of this for us native to python and R but in order to understand what's happening behind the scenes let's calculate bayes theorem from scratch. Here we'll create a ficticuous world in which we're testing patients for HIV. P(HIV) = The odds of a person having HIV is .015 or 1.5% P(Positive) = The probability the test results are positive P(Negative) = The probability the test results are negative. P(Positive | HIV) = The probability the test results are positive given someone has HIV. This is also called Sensitivity or True Positive Rate. We'll assume the test is correct .95 or 95% of the time. P(Positive | ~HIV) = The probability the test results are positive given someone does not have HIV. This is also called Specificity or True Negative Rate. We'll assume this is also correct .95 or 95% of the time. Baye's Formula: Where: - P(A) is the probability of A occuring independently, for us this is P(HIV) . - P(B) is the probability of B occuring independently, for us this is P(Positive) . - P(A|B) is the posterior probability of A occuring given B occurs, for us this is P(HIV | Positive) . This is the probability that an individual has HIV given their test results are positive and what we're trying to calculate. - P(B|A) is the likelihood probability of B occuring, given A occus. In our example this is P(Positive | HIV) . This value is given to us. Strining these together we get: P(HIV | Positive) = ((P(HIV) * P(Positive | HIV)) / P(Positive) Thus the probability of getting a positive HIV test result P(HIV) becomes: P(Positive) = [P(HIV) * Sensitivity] + [P(~HIV) * (1-Specificity)] #perfoming calculations: p_hiv = . 015 #P(HIV) assuming 1.5% of the population has HIV p_no_hiv = . 98 # P(~HIV) p_positive_hiv = . 95 #sensitivity p_negative_hiv = . 95 #specificity #P(Positive) p_positive = ( p_hiv * p_positive_hiv ) + ( p_no_hiv * ( 1 - p_negative_hiv )) print \"The probability of getting a positive test result is:\" , p_positive , \"this is our prior\" The probability of getting a positive test result is: 0.06325 this is our prior Using this prior we can calculate our posterior probalities as follows: The probability of an individual having HIV given their test result is positive. P(D|Positive) = (P(HIV) * Sensitivity)) / P(Positive) The probability of an individual not having HIV given their test result is positive. P(~D|Positive) = (P(~HIV) * (1-Sensitivity))) / P(Positive) Note: the sum of posteriors must equal one because combined they capture all possible states within our set of probabilities. #P(HIV | Positive) p_hiv_positive = ( p_hiv * p_positive_hiv ) / p_positive print \"The probability of a person having HIV, given a positive test result is:\" , p_hiv_positive The probability of a person having HIV, given a positive test result is: 0.225296442688 #P(~HIV | Positive) p_positive_no_hiv = 1 - p_positive_hiv p_no_hiv_positive = ( p_no_hiv * p_positive_no_hiv ) / p_positive print \"The probability of an individual not having HIV given getting a positive test result is:\" , p_no_hiv_positive The probability of an individual not having HIV given getting a positive test result is: 0.774703557312 That's it! We've just demonstrated how to calculate Bayes theorem from scrath. In our toy example we showed that if an individual gets a positive test result the probability this individual has HIV is 22.5% and 77.5% that they do not have HIV. We can check the validity of our results by summing the probability of both cases: posterior_sum = p_no_hiv_positive + p_hiv_positive posterior_sum #sum to 1, looks good! 1.0 5.1 Naive Bayes Classifier using Scikit-Learn In the above example we only the probability given two inputs (the test result and the status of the disease in the patient). This calculation would grow exponentially more complex given numerous inputs and would be painstaking to calculate by hand. Don't worry, SciKit-Learn is here to save the day (and a ton of time)! Our spam classifier will use multinomial naive bayes method from sklearn.nive_bayes . This method is well-suited for for discrete inputs (like word counts) whereas the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier performs better on continuous inputs. from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB naive_bayes = MultinomialNB () #call the method naive_bayes . fit ( train , y_train ) #train the classifier on the training set MultinomialNB(alpha=1.0, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True) predictions = naive_bayes . predict ( test ) #predic using the model on the testing set 6.1 Evaluating the Model After training our model we're now ready to evaluate its accuracy and precision. Accuracy: A ratio of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. Precision: The proportion of messages which were correctly classified as spam. This is a ratio of true positives (messages classified as SPAM which actually are SPAM) to all positives (all messages classified as SPAM). from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score , precision_score , f1_score print ( 'accuracy score: ' ), format ( accuracy_score ( y_test , predictions )) print ( 'precision score: ' ), format ( precision_score ( y_test , predictions )) accuracy score: 0.988513998564 precision score: 0.972067039106 Conclusion Through this excercise we learned how to implement bag of words and the naive bayes method first from scratch to gain insight into the technicalities of the methods and then again using scikit-learn to provide scalable results. We've learned that the naive bayes classifier can produce robust results without significant tuning to the model. Our final model classifies text messages as spam with 98.8% accuracy and 98.8% precision.","tags":"Projects","loc":"https://etav.github.io/projects/spam_message_classifier_naive_bayes.html","title":"Spam Classifier using Naive Bayes"},{"url":"https://etav.github.io/algorithms/bayes_theorem_scratch.html","text":"Implementing Bayes Theorem from Scratch Baye's theorem calculates the probability of a given class or state given the joint-probability distribution of the input variables (betas).

Introduction Matching high school students to colleges which will fit them well is a primary duties of high school guidance counselors. As the competition for jobs increases, attaining a bachelor's degree is a good way to differentiate and refine skills while providing time for students to mature into productive young adults. The main barrier to entry for many students is the hefty price tag of a college degree which has increased by 1,128% since 1978 (Bloomberg) . Currently the College Board reports the average private non-profit four-year tuition is $32,405 however, this price does factor in the cost of living for students which can greatly inflate this figure. The Wall Street Journal estimates that the average college graduate in 2015 will have $35,000 in student debt which is the highest level on record while the total dollar value attributable to student-loans in the US is rapidly approaching $70 billion . After considering both the potential future pay-off and the high-cost of pursuing a college education, the seriousness of this decision becomes obvious. Like many modern decision systems, the college application process relies heavily on data to make informed admissions decisions. As such, within the scope of this essay we will explore a data set from a specific college's admission office and use Random Forests from the CRAN() library to create a model which given inputs (ie: demographic information and scholastic metrics like GPA) will create a model to predict the likelihood of being admitted into a specific secondary institution. 2. The Data Our data set contains 8,700 observations and 9 variables. The data comes from a specific university's application office and each row contains variables related to the admission decision, the student's scholastic performance and other demographic information. In this section we will provide an overview of each variable before moving onto univariate analysis. Variable Name Description admit A binary factor where \"1\" indicates the student was admitted and \"0\" indicates a rejection. This is our response variable. anglo A binary factor where \"1\" indicates the student is Caucasian. asian A binary factor where \"1\" indicates the student is Asian. black A binary factor where \"1\" indicates the student is African American. gpa.weighted A numerical variable which provides a weighted GPA of the student (may be greater than 4.0 if the student was enrolled in AP courses). sati-verb A numerical variable capturing the student's verbal SAT score. sati-math A numerical variable capturing the student's math SAT score. income A numerical variable capturing the student's house-hold income, it has been capped at $100,000. sex A binary factor where \"1\" indicates the student is male. 2.1 Partitioning the Data: Training, Testing & Evaluation Sets For this implementation of the random forest algorithm we will not worry about creating training, testing and evaluation data sets because the randomForest function has a built-in OOB estimator which we can use to determine its performance and removing the necessity to set aside a training set. 2.2 Univariate Analysis In order to get a high-level understanding of our data we will examine the summary statistics conveniently provided by the R's summary() function before looking into any variable more specifically. Here's the output from the function: We will now comment on each variable independently. As we can tell from the output above, 2686 of the 8700 applicants were accepted which means admission rate for this university is: 2686/8700 = ~30.89% When comparing the admission rate for this university (31%) to that of the average 4-Year Private University (62.8%) we learn that it is twice as selective ( source ). Because all three of our our predictor variables related to a student's race capture the same type of information we will analyze them together. We have ethnic data for 6583 or approximately 76% of our test sample, we have 829 observations where there is missing ethnic data. Race Count Proportion (% of Total) Asian 3417 39% African American 356 4% Caucasian 2810 32% NA 856 10% Other 1261 15% Total 8700 100% Since the student's weighted GPA, SAT verbal and SAT Math scores are all numeric data-types, we will create histograms to analyze the distribution of each variable checking for normality and any potential outliers: Without performing sophisticated analysis we can tell these data look fairly normally distributed. However, we must note the large count of \"0s\" for SAT scores. Upon investigating it appears that we have missing data for 457 of our sample SAT scores. This should not cause too much concern because it is a relatively small proportion of our total sample. Furthermore, we should not remove the data because we can't tell if it is missing randomly or if there was systematic recording error present. We will keep these missing values in mind when we move on to model building. The final variable we will examine is house hold income. It is important to note that all house holds have been capped at an income of $100,000 , meaning that all income levels above this cut-off point will be labeled as \"$100,000\". This has a strong effect which becomes evident when we create a histogram of for this variable. ## 3. Multivariate Analysis We will limit the exploration of multivariate graphs and statistical relationships to numerical data, or specifically: SAT Math and SAT verbal scores, weighted GPA and household income . However, since Math SAT scores and Verbal SAT scores are strongly correlated (R-squared =.736), and thus explain similiar variance within the dataset we will only consider Math scores. Below are summary plots to visualize the relationships between our numerical variables. ## 4. Random Forests Background 4.1 Technicalities R's CART (Classification And Regression Trees) package which we will use to call the RandomForest function uses the following equation to define a splitting decision: ΔI(s,A) = I(A) - p(A_L)I(A_L) - p(A_R)I(A_R) Where I(A) is the value of \"impurity\" in a parent node, p(A_L) is the likelihood of a given case falling to the left of the parent node and I(A_L) is the impurity of the daughter node resulting from the split, while P(A_R) and I(A_R) capture similar information but for the right daughter node. Given the above formula the CART algorithm selects a predictor which maximizes ΔI(s,A). By doing so the algorithm is creating terminal nodes which look as homogeneous as possible within the node but as heterogeneous as possible when compared to other terminal nodes . By now it should become clear that Random Forests are simply a large number of decision trees, each node of which is subject to the above optimization ( CART Docs ). In reality, the formula for creating a splitting decision is the same for CART as RandomForest , the key difference is that RandomForest creates numerous decision trees sacrificing interpretability for increased predictive power. 5. Model Building With Random Forests After performing our variable exploration, univariate and bivarate analysis I feel comfortable moving on to building a Random Forest classifier using our data set. Without any model tuning, the algorithm provides the following confusion matrix: State Predicted: Not Admitted Predicted: Admitted Model Error Not Admitted (\"0\") 4240 308 6.7% Admitted (\"1\") 716 1240 36.6% Use Error 14.5% 19.9% Overall Error = 15.7% We have created a collection or \"forest\" featuring 500 decision trees. In this scenario we have not tuned our parameters and we will accept the default values for priors, this will serve as our baseline model which we can improve upon by tuning priors. The Out of Bag estimate for error rate provided is 15.7%. We also note that our model is under predicting the number of students which should be classified as being admitted (our model predicts 23.8% of students will be admitted but we know from our univariate analysis in section 2.2 that the admit rate should be closer to 31%). 5.1 Calling Random Forests #-----MODEL BUILDING: RANDOM FORESTS CALL----- library ( randomForest ) # random forests rf1 <- randomForest ( admit ~ . , data = data , importance = T , na.action = na.fail , ntree = 500 ) rf1 5.2 Model Tuning To correct for the algorithm under predicting the total number of students admitted we introduce priors and assign a cost ratio of 3 to 1 . What this means is that we are giving the algorithm \"slack\" while predicting whether a student is admitted and tightening our threshold for predicting whether someone is not admitted. After this modification we would expect a false positive rate 3 times greater than a false negative rate . The reason for selecting this ratio is because it seems more costly to fail to predict when someone is admitted compared to the scenario in which a student is classified as being admitted but was actually not.After running our entire data set through the randomForest() algorithm and setting our cost ration equal to 3 to 1, we arrive at the confusion matrix below: State Predicted: Not Admitted Predicted: Admitted Model Error Not Admitted (\"0\") 3536 1012 22.2% Admitted (\"1\") 294 1662 15% Use Error 7.7% 37.9% Overall Error = 20% Notice how the forecasted total number of students admitted went up, increasing the use error but decreasing the model error. 5.3 Model Evaluation As we see from the plot below the most important variables for predicting whether a student is admitted to this university are those related to academic achievement. For example, Weighted GPA, SAT Math and SAT Verbal Scores explain the most variance within the dataset for our model . While factors like income and race contributed to the accuracy, their effect was less pronounced in our model. We created partial dependency plots for each of our quantitative variables. The plots for weighted GPA begins to increase at 2.0 and peak around 3.5 meaning that values of weighted GPA between 3 and 3.5 tend to predict \"Admitted = True\" strongly. For both SAT verbal and SAT Math scores we see a similar trend. The odds of being admitted increase as levels of income reach above $90,000, see the partial dependency plots below for more details: 5.4 Conclusion Through this analysis we have gained a deeper understanding into the data behind college admissions. By analyzing the variables available to us we were able to determine that variables related to scholastic performance are much better for predicting the admittance rate of an individual student when compared with socioeconomic and racial factors . We tuned our model to a 3 to 1 cost ratio for false positives and false negatives, meaning we penalized the model by a factor of 3 to 1 when predicting whether a student was accepted. Initially the baseline model produced too many false negatives which was something I had not anticipated. For future analysis I would like to have a larger dataset which includes more than 1 university.","tags":"Projects","loc":"https://etav.github.io/projects/random_forest_college_admissions.html","title":"College Admissions Exploratory Analysis in R"},{"url":"https://etav.github.io/python/count_basic_freq_plot.html","text":"Counting is an essential task required for most analysis projects.

To detect colinearity among variables, simply create a correlation matrix and find variables with large absolute values. In R use the corr function and in python this can by accomplished by using numpy's corrcoef function. Multicolinearity on the other hand is more troublesome to detect because it emerges when three or more variables, which are highly correlated, are included within a model. To make matters worst multicolinearity can emerge even when isolated pairs of variables are not colinear. A common R function used for testing regression assumptions and specifically multicolinearity is \"VIF()\" and unlike many statistical concepts, its formula is straightforward: $$ V.I.F. = 1 / (1 - R&#94;2). $$ The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) is a measure of colinearity among predictor variables within a multiple regression. It is calculated by taking the the ratio of the variance of all a given model's betas divide by the variane of a single beta if it were fit alone. Steps for Implementing VIF Run a multiple regression. Calculate the VIF factors. Inspect the factors for each predictor variable, if the VIF is between 5-10, multicolinearity is likely present and you should consider dropping the variable. #Imports import pandas as pd import numpy as np from patsy import dmatrices import statsmodels.api as sm from statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence import variance_inflation_factor df = pd . read_csv ( 'loan.csv' ) df . dropna () df = df . _get_numeric_data () #drop non-numeric cols df . head () id member_id loan_amnt funded_amnt funded_amnt_inv int_rate installment annual_inc dti delinq_2yrs ... total_bal_il il_util open_rv_12m open_rv_24m max_bal_bc all_util total_rev_hi_lim inq_fi total_cu_tl inq_last_12m 0 1077501 1296599 5000.0 5000.0 4975.0 10.65 162.87 24000.0 27.65 0.0 ...

PCA is typically employed prior to implementing a machine learning algorithm because it minimizes the number of variables used to explain the maximum amount of variance for a given data set. PCA Introduction PCA uses \"orthogonal linear transformation\" to project the features of a data set onto a new coordinate system where the feature which explains the most variance is positioned at the first coordinate (thus becoming the first principal component). Source PCA allows us to quantify the trade-offs between the number of features we utilize and the total variance explained by the data. PCA allows us to determine which features capture similiar information and discard them to create a more parsimonious model. In order to perform PCA we need to do the following: PCA Steps Standardize the data. Use the standardized data to create a covariance matrix. Use the resulting matrix to calculate eigenvectors (principal components) and their corresponding eigenvalues. Sort the components in decending order by its eigenvalue. Choose n components which explain the most variance within the data (larger eigenvalue means the feature explains more variance). Create a new matrix using the n components. NOTE: PCA compresses the feature space so you will not be able to tell which variables explain the most variance because they have been transformed. If you'd like to preserve the original features to determine which ones explain the most variance for a given data set, see the SciKit Learn Feature Documentation . Resources 1.

The most important distinction between the initial data analysis phase (IDA) and the main analysis phase (EDA), is that during IDA phase the analyst refrains from any type of activities which directly answer the original research question. Typically the processes in the initial data analysis phase consist of: data quality checks, outlier detection (and treatment), assumption tests and any necessary transformations or imputations for non-normal or missing data. ( Source ) 0.2 In summary IDA seeks to accomplish the following: Uncover underlying structure of the dataset. Detect outliers and anomalies. Test any necessary underlying assumptions. Treatment of problems (typically through transformations or imputations). jerb 1. Understand Underlying Data Structure 1.1 Check the Quality of the Data (Important this happens first) Descriptive Summary Statistics (numerically) mean median standard deviation size of the data set (number of features & observations) 1.2 Check the Quality of Data Collection Method How was the data collected? Do we have any reason to believe the collection process could lead to systematic errors within the data? 2. Detect Outliers and Anomalies 2.1 Check for outliers within the dataset Numerically: using range, max-min functions or standard deviation (Rule of thumb: > 2 Standard deviations = potential outlier) . Visually: histograms. 2.2 Check the normality of the dataset This can be accomplished by plotting a frequency distribution (histogram) for each feature (given a small number of features) and identify any skewness present. Here the analyst should also make note of any missing or miscoded data and decide how to handle it (typically through dropping, or transforming). 3. Test Underlying Assumptions The assumptions the analyst must make will vary based on the model or type of analysis employed. In this example we use the assumptions for linear regression. 3. 1 Assumptions for linear regression: Check for no multicollinearity (collinearity) Ensure Homoscedasticity Linear Relationship Normally distributed No auto-correlation Source: 4. Treat Potential Problems At this step the analyst decides to impute missing data, or transform non-normal variables. Transforming variables is a key tool for analysts because it enables her to manipulate the shape of the distribution or nature of the relationship while preserving the information captured by the variable because at any time during the analysis the analyst can reverse the transformation and get the original value of the variable. 4.1 Transformations Scenario Action The variables's distribution differs moderately from the original. Perform a square root transformation by squaring the observations (x&#94;2). The data's distribution differs significantly from the original. Perform a log transformation by taking the natural logarithm of the observations (log(x)). The data's distribution differs severe from the original. Perform an inverse transformation by taking the inverse of a variable (1/x). Another variant would be to take the negative inverse (-1/x) The data's distribution differs severely and none of the above actions worked. Perform an ordinal transformation by changing the variable's type. ( Source: Boston College ) 4.2 Treatment of Problems After performing necessary transformations, it's vital that the analyst decides how to deal with potential problems and implement any necessary changes within the data before moving onto the next phase. Scenario Action A variable is not normally distributed. Transform using a technique in table 4.1. The dataset is missing data. The analyst should either neglect or impute ( imputation techniques in R ). Significant outliers present. The analyst should either drop outliers or (depending on the weight they carry) transform the variable. Small sample dataset. Here, the analyst should consider using bootstrapping , or resampling with replacement, to project the structure of the dataset onto a larger number of observations. NANs & Infs present. Sometimes datasets will contain NANs or Infs (likely caused by contaminated observations or division by zero) here the analyst must decide to drop the specific observations, or the variable entirely. Incorrect variable types. This problem is often encountered when dealing with time and monetary variables. Here the analyst should decide to change the variables data type or drop it from the analysis.

Exploratory data analysis techniques are designed to for open-minded exploration and not guided by a research question. EDA should not be thought of as an exhaustive set of steps to be strictly followed but rather a mindset or philosophy the analyst brings with her to guide her exploration. The analyst uses EDA techniques to \"tease out\" the underlying structure of the data and manipulate it in ways that will reveal otherwise hidden patterns, relationships and features. EDA techniques are primarily graphical because humans have innate pattern recognition abilities which we utilize to synthesize complex conclusions from visual cues. The goal of EDA is to accomplish the following: Maximize insight into a data set. Understand and rank variables by importance. Determine the optimal trade-offs between parsimonious and accurate models. Determine optimal factor settings (such as tuning priors or making manual adjustments to statistical algorithms). 5.2 EDA Steps: Plot raw data. Plot simple statistics. Position the plots in a manner than maximizes the number of inferences a viewer can make while minimizing the both the time it takes and the \"Data-ink ratio\" used to arrive at these insights. (Optional) Leverage the insights from the graphical and statistical analysis to inform model building activities such as feature selection, transformation, and tuning. Some of these steps may seem redundant but it's important to remember that any transformations or significant adjustments to the dataset should have been carried out in the IDA phase . In the EDA phase we must ensure these adjustments had the intended effect and do not contaminate or misrepresent the dataset. ( Source: Engineering Statistics Handbook ) 6. Plotting Raw Data 6.1 Bivaraite Analysis Re-examine the frequency distribution of each variable (for a small number of variables) and ensure they meet expectations. If transformation or imputation has been performed on the variable, note the effect. Histograms 6.2 Multivariate Analysis Begin to examine the nature of the relationships between variables within the dataset. Here the analyst should note any strong relationships (linear or otherwise) or potentially confounding variables which will inform variable selection if model building is the intended goal. Scatter Plots Pairs Plots (Python: seaborn.pairs() , R: pairs() ) 7. Plotting Simple Statistics 7.1 Simple Summary Statistics Similiar to step 1.1, except we must re-examine the summary statistics for transformed or imputed variables, except this time with an emphasis on analyzing the information visually. Mean Median Standard deviation Box plots (or quantile plots) Size of the data set (number of features & observations) Especially if observations or features were dropped or bootstrapped in phase 4.2. Helpful Functions Python pandas.describe function ( docs ) R summary function ( docs ) 8. Position & Present 8.1 Presenting the findings At this point in the exploration the analyst should have: 1. An understanding of the underlying data structure (visually & numerically). (1.1, 1.2, 6.1, 7.1) 2. Insight into the relationships between variables. (6.2) 3. The impact of transformations, imputations or any other significant changes to the original dataset. (4.1, 4.2) The analyst should now feel comfortable positioning their plots and summary statistics in a manner than maximizes the number of inferences a viewer can make while minimizing the both the time it takes and the amount of ink used to arrive at these insights . This could be in the form of a dash board, a single visualization, multiple visualizations or any other acceptable medium of presentation with the goal presenting the data in a manner that engages the viewer and challenges them to ponder its impact and implications ( Source: Introduction to Survey Design ). 9. Model Building Model building is typically the final stage of any analysis. It comes last because the analyst should have a deep understanding of the dataset and how the variables relate to one another. Posessing this information will simplify the following. 9.1 Model Selection What is the goal of the model? How big is the data set? (observations) How many features are contained in the dataset? (variables) Does the data lend itself to supervised or unsupervised machine learning methods? 9.2 Model Fitting Break the dataset into training and testing sets (Rule of thumb: 80/20 split) . Feature Selection & Ranking Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Forward Selection Backward Selection Selecting your algorithm there are many . 9.3 Model Validation Fit the model you selected in 9.1 to your training set and run the testing set through the model to determine its error rate. This rate will differ between modeling techniques. Perform model tuning by adjusting for things like type I and type II error, re-fitting the model after each adjustment. 9.4 EDA Conclusion At the end of the EDA process, the analyst should have the following: - Treatment for outliers and abnormal data. - A ranked list of a dataset's features and how they contribute to the model. - Conclusions or insights arrived at as a result of the exploratory analysis. - A statistically sound and parsimonious model. Guding EDA Questions What is a typical value for a given feature within a dataset? How is the data distributed? Does a given factor have a significant effect on an outcome? What are the most important factors for predicting a given response variable? What is the best model for forecasting unknown values of a response variable? What is signal vs noise in time series data? Does the dataset have outliers?","tags":"Articles","loc":"https://etav.github.io/articles/ida_eda_method.html","title":"Initial & Exploratory Analysis Method"},{"url":"https://etav.github.io/algorithms/knn_implementation_scikit-learn.html","text":"K-Nearest Neighbors Resources: Wikipedia SciKit-Learn StatSoft Definition K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm (aka kNN) can be used for both classification (data with discrete variables) and regression (data with continuous labels). The algorithm functions by calculating the distance (Sci-Kit Learn uses the formula for Euclidean distance but other formulas are available) between instances to create local \"neighborhoods\". K-Nearest Neighbors functions by maximizing the homogeneity amongst instances within a neighborhood while also maximizing the heterogeneity of instances between neighborhoods. So each member of a given neighborhood \"looks like\" (has similar variables) all of the other members of that neighborhood. One neat feature of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is the number of neighborhoods can be user defined or generated by the algorithm using the local density of points. The Scikit—Learn Function: sklearn.neighbors accepts numpy arrays or scipy.sprace matrices are inputs. For this implementation I will use the classic 'iris data set' included within scikit-learn as a toy data set.

We use our data to train The kNN Classifier. * This will allow the algorithm to define new neighborhoods. 2. Once the neighborhoods are defined, our classifier will be able to ingest feature data (petal and sepal measurements) on flowers it has not been trained on and determine which neighborhood it is most homogenous to. * Once the neighborhoods have been defined we can actually use the classifier in a generalizable fashion on new data. 3. We can determine the accuracy (and usefulness) of our model by seeing how many flowers it accurately classifies on a testing data set. * In order to do this the actual species must be known. from sklearn import neighbors , datasets # where X = measurements and y = species X , y = data . data , data . target #define the model knn = neighbors .

As we can see from this plot, the virgincia species is relatively easier to classify when compared to versicolor and setosa. kNN Plot Conclusion The number of neighbors to implement is highly data-dependent meaning optimal neighborhood sizes will differ greatly between data sets. It is important to select a classifier which balances generalizability (precision) and accuracy or we are at risk of overfitting. For example, if we pick a classifier which fits the data perfectly we will lose the ability to make generalizable inferences from it (this would look like the 'low accuracy', 'high precision' scenario below because our model is very good at predicting training data but misses completely when presented with new data). Best practice is to test multiple classifiers using a testing data set to ensure we're making appropriate trade-offs between accuracy and generalizability.

Although the statistical techniques which underpin machine learning have existed for decades recent developments in technology such as the availability/affordability of cloud computing and the ability to store and manipulate big data have accelerated its adoption. This essay is meant to explore the most popular methods currently being employed by data scientists such as supervised and unsupervised methods to people with little to no understanding of the field. (An example of a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm being used to create a decision boundary (via wikipedia ) Supervised Supervised machine learning describes an instance where inputs along with the outputs are known. We know the beginning and the end of the story and the challenge is to find a function (story teller, if you will) which best approximates the output in a generalizable fashion. Example : Imagine a doctor trying to predict whether someone has HIV. He has the test results (outputs) and medical records (variables) for patients who have tested positive and negative for the disease. His task is to look at the records and develop a decisioning system so that when a new patient arrives, given just their medical record (variables) he can accurately predict whether or not they are HIV positive. (A graphic represention a logistic regression) Unsupervised Unsupervised machine learning is a bit more abstract because it describes a scenario in which only know the input variables are known but nothing about the outputs are known. A typical task for this type of machine learning is clustering , or grouping the data by using features, to arrive at generalizable insights. Clustering using K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm Semi-Supervised Semi-supervised learning is a hybrid of supervised and unsupervised machine learning . This describes a scenario where there is a small portion of labeled data mixed with unlabeled data. Acquiring labeled data is costly because typically it requires manual input from humans to generate. Semi-supervised learning allows for quicker turn-around while sacrificing accuracy (increasing labeled data increases model accuracy) but it is usually more accurate than unsupervised learning alone. Reinforcement learning Reinforcement learning , or simulation based optimization is a relatively lesser known branch of machine learning but where the future of AI is headed because it requires almost no human input . It's also what enabled Google's Alpha Go to be so successful—and which we'll use for illustrative purposes (here's the research paper ) . Reinforcement learning describes a situation in which humans provide the following: An environment (A Go board) A set of rules (The rules of Go) A Set of actions (All the actions that can be taken) A set of outcomes (Win or lose) Then given an environment, rules, actions and outcomes a computer can repeatedly simulate many, many games of Go and \"learn\" (optimzie) for what strategies work best in a given scenario. What makes reinforcement learning extremely powerful is the sheer number of times a computer can simulate unique games. By the time Alpha Go faced Lee Sedol, the top player in the world, it had simulated more games than Sedol could've ever hoped to play in his lifetime. Humans need to eat, sleep and take breaks, computers don't they just require electricity.

The goal was to create a classifier to predict the outcome of a sheltered animal using features such the animal's gender, age and breed. The training dataset contains 26,729 observations, 9 predictor variables and was given to us by the Austin Animal Shelter. Exploratory Analysis Before I dive into creating a classifier, I typically perform an exploratory analysis moving from observing one univariate statistics to bivariate statistics and finally model building. However, I broke from my normal process as curiosity got the best of me. I was interested in learning about what the typical outcomes are for sheltered animals (check out the graph below). Luckily, as we see above, many animals are either adopted, transferred or in the case of dogs frequently returned to their owners. The Variables [ 1 ] \"ID\" \"Name\" \"DateTime\" \"OutcomeType\" \"OutcomeSubtype\" \"AnimalType\" [ 7 ] \"SexuponOutcome\" \"AgeuponOutcome\" \"Breed\" \"Color\" Variable Name Description ID The animal's unique ID. Name The animal's name, if known (many are not). DateTime The date and time the animal entered the shelter (ranges from 1/1/14 - 9/9/15). OutcomeType A five factor variable detailing the outcome for the animal (ie: adopted,transferred, died). OutcomeSubtype 17 factor variable containing Further details related to the outcome of the animal, such as whether or not they were aggressive. AnimalType Whether the animal is a cat or dog. SexuponOutcome The sex of the animal at the time the outcome was recorded. AgeuponOutcome The age of the animal when the outcome was recorded. Breed The breed of the animal (contains mixed breed). Color A Description of the coloring on the animal. Transforming Variables The first thing I did was transform the date variable by separating time and date so that I can analyze them independently, I'd like to be able to compare time of day and any seasonality effects on adoption. I then moved on to address missing name values (there were a few mis-codings which caused errors). After that I moved onto transforming the \"AgeuponOutcome\" variable so that the reported age of animals would all be in the same units, I chose days. This took some chaining of ifelse statements: Animal's Age #Animal Age split <- str_split_fixed ( train $ AgeuponOutcome , \" \" , 2 ) # split value and unit of time split [, 2 ] <- gsub ( \"s\" , \"\" , split [, 2 ]) #remove tailing \"s\" #create a vector to multiply multiplier <- ifelse ( split [, 2 ] == 'day' , 1 , ifelse ( split [, 2 ] == 'week' , 7 , ifelse ( split [, 2 ] == 'month' , 30 , ifelse ( split [, 2 ] == 'year' , 365 , NA )))) train $ days_old <- as.numeric ( split [, 1 ]) * multiplier #apply the multiplier train $ days_old [ 1 : 5 ] #compare, looks good train $ AgeuponOutcome [ 1 : 5 ] After this transformation, we're able to create a visualization which tells us the outcome of each animal type as a function of its age (in days). Interestingly the likelihood of being adopted for cats varies with age whereas for dogs there appears to be a slight negative correlation between a it's age and the probability it will be adopted. For dogs, it seems older animals tend to have a higher likelihood of being returned to their owner (I assume this is has to do with the proliferation of chips for animals) Animal's Gender Moving on I decided to compare the differences in outcomes based on the animal's gender. It's clear that adopters favor animals (both cats and dogs) that have previously been neutered. It's interesting to note that a large proportion of cats which were not neutered are transferred to another animal shelter, where (my guess is) they are then neutered. Applying Random Forest After transforming our variables, performing univariate analysis and determining the validity of our sample, it's finally time to move to model building. I will create a random forest using the RandomForest package, using OutcomeType as our predictor variable (remember there are five levels, which complicates things a bit). rf1 <- randomForest ( OutcomeType ~ AnimalType + SexuponOutcome + Named + days_old + young + color_simple , data = train , importance = T , ntree = 500 , na.action = na.fail ) rf1 Our random forest model does poorly at classifying animal deaths which makes sense when we consider only 197/26729 or 0.007370272% of our training set were flagged as \"Died\". The model does fairly well at predicting instances where an adoption, transfer, or euthanasia occurs which make up the bulk of the training set. Furthermore, our OOB or out of bag error estimate is 35.28%. Here's a detailed breakdown of our Random Forest: #Calling Random Forest Call : randomForest ( formula = OutcomeType ~ AnimalType + SexuponOutcome + Named + days_old + young + color_simple , data = train , importance = T , ntree = 500 , na.action = na.fail ) Type of random forest : classification Number of trees : 500 No. of variables tried at each split : 2 OOB estimate of error rate : 35.28 % Confusion matrix : Adoption Died Euthanasia Return_to_owner Transfer class.error Adoption 8988 0 2 1391 388 0.1653821 Died 21 0 10 10 156 1.0000000 Euthanasia 229 0 175 380 771 0.8874598 Return_to_owner 1998 0 9 2393 386 0.5000000 Transfer 2641 0 83 954 5744 0.3903630 Determining Variable Importance Finally, we'll rank our predictor variables based on their mean reduction in Gini error. As we see in the graphic above, the animal's sex and age were most useful to reduce the mean Gini Error. Interestingly, animal type (ie: cat or dog) and the physical features of the animal such as the color mattered less. That's all for this one folks, thanks for tuning in!","tags":"Projects","loc":"https://etav.github.io/projects/random_forest_animal_shelter.html","title":"Animal Shelter Classifier using Random Forest"}]}
